Web App Testing Automation
Selenium with Ruby testing stack

[Opening] take 2
Hello, everyone! 
I welcome you to today’s episode of Coding Playground. Continuing with the exciting journey of automated web application testing I will explore the use of Ruby tech stack. Typically these types of projects are called end-to-end automation frameworks and they mainly depend on a browser automation tool and a programming language of choice, which, I have chosen to be the Ruby Programming language

[General Approach]


Web applications use a web browser to launch an application or game. We need to build a virtual user that can use the browser application just like you or I would. Our approach involves:
Using the browser control tool "Selenium WebDriver", to impersonate a real life user.
Using Ruby as the programming language to use the browder control tool
Using Minitest to help us describe the tests that we  want to run on our selected web app
Using Minitest-Reporters to report the results after running those automated tests
Using Rake to automatically execute those tests

Let me break down the roles of each tool and library in 

[ WIP ] [Tools and Libraries]


"Selenium WebDriver: This powerful tool allows us to automate browser actions, making our testing process efficient and reliable. It's the driving force behind our interactions with the web application."
"Ruby: Our programming language of choice. Its simplicity and readability make it a fantastic companion for our testing endeavors. Plus, it's the backbone of our automation scripts."
"Rake: Meet our automation sidekick! Rake helps us organize and execute tasks seamlessly. It's a fantastic tool for automation, making our testing workflows more manageable."
"Minitest: This lightweight testing framework ensures that our tests are structured, readable, and easy to maintain. It's our trusty companion in the world of test-driven development."
"Pros and Cons: While Selenium offers robust browser automation, Ruby's elegance makes our code clean and expressive. Rake streamlines tasks, but keep in mind its learning curve. Minitest provides simplicity but may lack some advanced features."

[Tools and Libraries Overview]


"Selenium WebDriver, a cornerstone in our testing arsenal, provides a robust way to automate interactions with web browsers. Its versatility allows us to simulate user actions and validate the behavior of our web applications."
"Ruby, the language of choice for our project, provides a clean and expressive syntax. Its integration with Selenium WebDriver ensures seamless automation, allowing us to write concise and readable test scripts."
"Rake, our automation task tool, plays a crucial role in managing and executing our tests. It simplifies the process, making it easy to run specific test suites or the entire suite with a single command."
"Minitest, our testing framework, provides a lightweight yet powerful testing environment. With minimal setup, we can create effective test cases and assertions, ensuring the reliability of our web app."
"Minitest-Reporters enhances our testing experience by providing detailed reports. It generates HTML reports, giving us valuable insights into test results."

[Rake as an Automation Tool]
"Now, let's talk about Rake. This powerful automation tool simplifies our tasks, making it a crucial element in our testing process. Rake allows us to define, organize, and execute tasks efficiently, enhancing our automation capabilities."
"Rake, the unsung hero of automation, simplifies and streamlines our testing tasks. It allows us to define, organize, and execute tasks with ease. In our case, it effortlessly manages our test suite, making automation a breeze."
[Role of Rake]
"Rake plays a crucial role as our automation tool, simplifying complex tasks and providing an organized structure. In the Rakefile, we define tasks, and by running 'rake test,' we effortlessly execute our test suites defined in the 'test/specs' directory."

[Code Files Overview]
"Let's take a peek into our code files to understand how everything comes together."
"Starting with the `README.md`, it provides easy steps for setup and execution. Remember to check your Ruby installation and run 'bundle install' to get started."
"Next up, our `Rakefile`. This file defines our default task as running tests. It's the conductor orchestrating our test suite."
"The `GemFile` lists our essential gems – Selenium WebDriver, Minitest, Minitest-Reporters, and Rake. These gems form the foundation of our project."
"Moving on to `test/test_helper.rb`, it configures Minitest to use the HTML reporter, enhancing our test reporting capabilities."
"In `test/helpers/webdriver_helper.rb`, we initialize our Selenium WebDriver, customizing it for a smooth testing experience."
"And finally, our test scripts. For instance, in `checkboxes_test.rb`, we automate toggling checkboxes, ensuring our application behaves as expected."
"Similarly, in `disappearing_elements_test.rb`, we tackle the challenge of disappearing elements, checking if the page refreshes properly."

[Slide 5: Code Files Overview]
**README.md:**"The project's README.md provides a quick guide on setting up Ruby and cloning the repository. It's your first step toward seamless web application testing."
**Rakefile:**"The Rakefile is the orchestrator of our automation symphony. It defines tasks, including running our tests, making our testing process efficient and organized."
**GemFile:**"The Gemfile lists the project's dependencies, ensuring that we have all the necessary gems, such as Selenium WebDriver and Minitest, at our disposal."
**test_helper.rb:**"The test_helper.rb file configures Minitest and sets up the HTML reporter, enhancing the clarity of our test results."
